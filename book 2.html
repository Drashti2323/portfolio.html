<h3>Chemical Reaction 
    <br>and Equation
</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Chemical reaction</h4>
<p>Chemical reactions are chemical changes in which reactants transform into products by making or breaking bonds (or both) between different atoms. <br> <br> 

    A chemical reaction is a process that causes one set of chemical components to change into another. Chemical reactions are defined as changes in the locations of electrons in the formation and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change in the nuclei, and are described using a chemical equation. At a given temperature and chemical concentration, chemical reactions occur at a predictable rate. Reacti
    on speeds often increase as the temperature rises because more thermal energy is available to attain the activation energy required to break bonds between atoms.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Chemical Equation</h4>
    <p>A  word equation is a chemical reaction expressed in words rather than chemical formulas. It helps identify the reactants and products in a chemical reaction. <br><br>

        A chemical reaction is described using a word equation, which is a shorthand manner of expressing it. The names of the reactants are shown on the left side of a word equation. If there is more than one reactant, the names of the reactants are separated by a plus sign (+). Products are shown on the right side of a word equation. If there is more than one product, the names of the products are separated by a plus sign (+).
        <br>
        For example,<br>
        Sodium + Chlorine → Sodium chloride
        <br>The above equation means: “Sodium reacts with chlorine to form sodium chloride.”</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Types of Chemical Reaction</h4>
        <p>Taking into consideration different factors, chemical reactions are grouped into multiple categories.
           <br> A few examples are:
           <br> ● Combination
           <br> ● Decomposition
           <br> ● Single Displacement
            <br>● Double displacement
           <br> ● Redox
           <br> ● Endothermic
           <br> ● Exothermic
           <br> ● Precipitation
            <br>● Neutralisation</p>

            <h3>Acid And Base</h3>
            <hr>
            <h4>Acid And Base</h4>
            <p>
                An acid is any hydrogen-containing substance that is capable of donating a proton (hydrogen ion) to another substance.  A base is a molecule or ion able to accept a hydrogen ion from an acid.

<br><br>Acidic substances are usually identified by their sour taste. An acid is basically a molecule which can donate an H+ ion and can remain energetically favourable after a loss of H+. Acids are known to turn blue litmus red.

<br><br>Bases, on the other hand, are characterized by a bitter taste and a slippery texture. A base that can be dissolved in water is referred to as an alkali. When these substances chemically react with acids, they yield salts. Bases are known to turn red litmus blue.
            </p>
            <h4>Indicator</h4>
            <p>A chemical compound that changes color and structure when exposed to certain conditions and is therefore useful for chemical tests. Litmus, for example, is an indicator that becomes red in the presence of acids and blue in the presence of bases.</p>
            <h4> ph Scale</h4>
            <p>In order to find the numeric value of the level of acidity or basicity of a substance, the pH scale (wherein pH stands for ‘potential of hydrogen’) can be used. The pH scale is the most common and trusted way to measure how acidic or basic a substance is. A pH scale measure can vary from 0 to 14, where 0 is the most acidic and 14 is the most basic a substance can be.
<br><br>
                Another way to check if a substance is acidic or basic is to use litmus paper. There are two types of litmus paper available that can be used to identify acids and bases – red litmus paper and blue litmus paper. Blue litmus paper turns red under acidic conditions and red litmus paper turns blue under basic or alkaline conditions.</p>

<h4>Nutrition</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Autotrophic Nutrition <p>“Autotrophic nutrition is a process where an organism prepares its own food from a simple inorganic material like water, mineral salts and carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight.” The term “autotrophic” is formed by the combination of two terms, “auto” meaning self, and “trophic” meaning nutrition.</p>

    </li>
    <li>Hetrotrophic Nutrition 
        <p>Heterotrophs are known as consumers because they consume producers or other consumers. Dogs, birds, fish, and humans are all examples of heterotrophs. Heterotrophs occupy the second and third levels in a food chain, a sequence of organisms that provide energy and nutrients for other organisms.</p>

    </li>
<
</ul>
 <h4>Respiration</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>Respiration and its types
        <p>Respiration includes the exchange of gases as well as the burning of food. Animals have a well-defined respiratory system for respiration.

           <br><br>] In the process of respiration, glucose is broken down to extract energy. It is a redox reaction which can take place with or without oxygen and takes place in the mitochondria of the cell and releases energy in the form of ATP.
            
           <br><br> Respiration is mainly of two types- aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Exchange of gases in plant and Animals
        <p>Stomata are the centres of exchange of gases in plants. The gases diffuse into the intercellular spaces of the leaf through these pores, which are normally on the underside of the leaf.
            <br><br>In animals, gas exchange follows the same general pattern that occurs in plants. Oxygen and carbon dioxide move through diffusion into the moist membrane. In simple animals, the exchange is mainly with the environment. But with complex animals, such as mammals, there is an exchange between the environment and blood.
        </p>

    </li>
    <li>Human respiratory system
        <p>The respiratory system includes the nose, mouth, throat, voice box, windpipe, and lungs. Air enters the respiratory system through the nose or the mouth. If it goes in the nostrils (also called nares), the air is warmed and humidified.</p>
    </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Transportation </h4>
 <ul>
    <li>Transportation in human beings
        <p> The components of the transport system in human beings are the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The function of the heart is to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body and receives deoxygenated blood from the various body parts and sends this impure blood to the lungs for oxygenation. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Transportation in plants
        <p>The transport system in plants consists of xylem and phloem tissues. Xylem tissue is responsible for the transport of minerals and water from the roots to the leaves. Phloem tissue transport sugars made in the leaves to all other parts of the plant.</p>

    </li>
 </ul>  
 <h4>Excreation</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>Excreation in human beings
    <p>Excretion in Humans. Excretion is the process where all the metabolic wastes are removed from the body. Excretion in humans is carried through different body parts and internal organs in a series of processes. Diffusion is the most common process of excretion in lower organisms.</p>

    </li>
    <li>Excreation in plnts 
        <p>Excretion is carried out in the plants in the following ways: The gaseous wastes, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are removed through the stomata of leaves and lenticels of stems. Some waste products collect in the leaves and bark of trees. When the leaves and bark are shed, the wastes are eliminated.</p>
    </li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Ecosystem</h4>
 <p>The ecosystem comprises all the biotic and abiotic factors interacting with one another in a given area. Biotic components include all living organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and humans, etc., and abiotic components include sunlight, temperature, air, wind, rainfall, soil and minerals, etc. E.g. pond ecosystem, grassland ecosystem, etc.

 </p>
 <h4>Trophic level</h4>
 <p>It refers to the various levels in a food web as per the flow of energy. The different trophic levels are –

   <br>
   <ul>
    <li>Producers (T1) </li>
    <li>Primary consumers (herbivores-T2)</li>
    <li>Secondary consumers (primary carnivores -T2)</li>
    <li>Tertiary consumers(Sec carnivores -T3)</li>
    <li>Quaternary consumers (Ter. carnivores T4)</li>
    <li>Decomposers</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enviourment</h4>
<p>All the physical surroundings on Earth are called the environment. The environment includes everything living and everything nonliving. The nonliving part of the environment has three main parts: the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the lithosphere. </p>

<p>ONE day back there in the good old days when I was nine and the
    world was full of every imaginable kind of magnificence, and life
    was still a delightful and mysterious dream, my cousin Mourad,
    who was considered crazy by everybody who knew him except
    me, came to my house at four in the morning and woke me up
    tapping on the window of my room.
    Aram, he said. <br><br> I jumped out of bed and looked out of the window.
    I couldn’t believe what I saw.
    It wasn’t morning yet, but it was summer and with daybreak
    not many minutes around the corner of the world it was light
    enough for me to know I wasn’t dreaming.
    My cousin Mourad was sitting on a beautiful white horse.
    I stuck my head out of the window and rubbed my eyes.
    Yes, he said in Armenian. It’s a horse. You’re not dreaming.
    Make it quick if you want to ride. <br><br>That year we lived at the edge of town, on Walnut Avenue.
    Behind our house was the country: vineyards, orchards,
    irrigation ditches, and country roads. <p/>

 <hr> <p> Consequently, even though I could see the horse, so
        magnificent; even though I could smell it, so lovely; even though
        I could hear it breathing, so exciting; I couldn’t believe the horse
        had anything to do with my cousin Mourad or with me or with
        any of the other members of our family, asleep or awake, because
        I knew my cousin Mourad couldn’t have bought the horse, and
        if he couldn’t have bought it he must have stolen it, and I refused
        to believe he had stolen it. <br><br> No member of the Garoghlanian family could be a thief.
        I stared first at my cousin and then at the horse. There was
        a pious stillness and humour in each of them which on the one
        hand delighted me and on the other frightened me.
        Mourad, I said, where did you steal this horse?
        Leap out of the window, he said, if you want to ride.
        It was true, then. He had stolen the horse. There was no
        question about it. He had come to invite me to ride or not, as
        I chose. <br> <br> Well, it seemed to me stealing a horse for a ride was not the
        same thing as stealing something else, such as money. For all I
        knew, maybe it wasn’t stealing at all. If you were crazy about</p>

    <hr><p>On our second day out of Cape Town, we began to encounter
        strong gales. For the next few weeks, they blew continuously.
        Gales did not worry me; but the size of the waves was alarming —
        up to 15 metres, as high as our main mast.
        December 25 found us 3,500 kilometres east of Cape Town. <br><br>
        Despite atrocious weather, we had a wonderful holiday complete
        with a Christmas tree. New Year’s Day saw no improvement in
        the weather, but we reasoned that it had to change soon. And it
        did change — for the worse.
        At dawn on January 2, the waves were gigantic. We were
        sailing with only a small storm jib and were still making eight
        knots. As the ship rose to the top of each wave we could see
        endless enormous seas rolling towards us, and the screaming
        of the wind and spray was painful to the ears. To slow the boat
        down, we dropped the storm jib and lashed a heavy mooring
        rope in a loop across the stern. <br><br> Then we double-lashed
        everything, went through our life-raft drill, attached lifelines,
        donned oilskins and life jackets — and waited.
        The first indication of impending disaster came at about
        6 p.m., with an ominous silence. The wind dropped, and the
        sky immediately grew dark.  </p>

<hr> <p>MY grandmother, like everybody’s grandmother, was an old
    woman. She had been old and wrinkled for the twenty years
    that I had known her. People said that she had once been
    young and pretty and had even had a husband, but that was
    hard to believe. My grandfather’s portrait hung above the
    mantelpiece in the drawing room. He wore a big turban and
    loose-fitting clothes. His long, white beard covered the best
    part of his chest and he looked at least a hundred years old.
    He did not look the sort of person who would have a wife or
    children. He looked as if he could only have lots and lots of
    grandchildren. <br><br> As for my grandmother being young and pretty,
    the thought was almost revolting. She often told us of the
    games she used to play as a child. That seemed quite absurd
    and undignified on her part and we treated it like the fables
    of the Prophets she used to tell us.
    She had always been short and fat and slightly bent. Her
    face was a criss-cross of wrinkles running from everywhere to
    everywhere. <br> <br> No, we were certain she had always been as we had
     the thought was almost revolting
     an expanse of pure white serenity
     a turning-point.</p>
